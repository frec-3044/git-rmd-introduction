## What is Git and GitHub

-   Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. (Wikipedia)
-   GitHub, Inc. (owned by Microsoft) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, and manage their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. (Wikipedia)

## Why Git and GitHub

-   Git and GitHub (or related GitLab) are widely used in data science jobs for code development and collaboration
-   Help you keep track of changes so you know what you did and when.
-   GitHub is a backup of your work
-   Goal in class: foundation building for you to learn more as needed

## Concepts

-   Repository (Repo)
-   Clone
-   Commit
-   Push
-   Pull
-   Fork

## Quarto

-   An open-source scientific and technical publishing system
-   Notebooks, articles, websites, blogs, books, slides
-   Update to Rmarkdown (and very similar)
-   https://quarto.org

## Assignment workflow

-   Accept (e.g., fork) assignment
-   Clone your accepted assignment repo to your computer
-   Work on assignment (many commits)
-   Push assignment to GitHub (many times - this a backup)
-   Final render of the document to HTML
-   Commit and push HTML to GitHub
-   Upload HTML to Canvas

## Common mistakes

-   HTML uploaded to Canvas but not **pushed** to GitHub (commit + push required).
-   Version of HTML of Canvas does not match version on GitHub
-   Images and plots do not show up on HTML on Canvas, despite you seeing them on your computer.
